Build a production-ready Flutter mobile app UI for an AI-powered face analysis and look-maxing application.

The app is frontend-only and consumes data from an existing backend API. Do NOT implement any time-travel, virtual date, or next-day simulation logic.

Core Screens & UI Requirements

1. Dashboard Screen

Personalized greeting using user name.

Conditionally show a message:
“Your Looks Score improved by X% this month”
(only visible if backend sends improvement data).

Current facial stats displayed as cards with progress bars:

Symmetry

Jawline

Facial Proportions

Skin Clarity

Masculinity

Cheekbones

If no scan history exists, show example placeholder values.

2. Daily Tips Section

Static list of daily improvement tips (same for all users).

Each tip shown as a checklist card.

Clean, minimal, fitness-app style UI.

3. Weekly Analysis Screen

Display:

Total scans completed this week

Improvement percentage since last week

Consistency score shown as a circular progress indicator

All values are read-only and come from backend responses.

4. Challenges Screen

Weekly challenges displayed as cards:

Drink water

Sleep 8 hours

Eat healthy

Facial exercises

Daily walking goal

Walking distance value is passed from backend (no calculation in frontend).

5. Scan Flow Screen

Camera placeholder UI

Scan counter indicator (e.g., 1/3, 2/3, 3/3)

Simple lifestyle questions form (sleep, diet, water, exercise)

“Generate My Plan” button

6. Improvement Plan Screen

Technical Constraints
